Documentation
=======

Introduction
-------------
Do not hesitate to document the code.

Format
-------
The documentation should be in markdown. Strive to use the most basic markdown and avoid to rely on GFM (Gitlab Flavored Makdown).

Organization
------------
It should be placed based on its target audience:
 - The technical folder for technical documentation
 - The functional folder for external users and product documentation

In both of these folders, if a documentation is specific for a product, put it in a folder named by the concerned product.

Diagrams
--------
Whatever the diagram tool you choose, the diagram, schema or any kind of assets must at least respect these requirements:
 - it has to be externalized and imported in the documentation
 - it has to be accessible to others to be able to easily edit it if necessary

If you don't know what to use, see [draw.io](https://draw.io).

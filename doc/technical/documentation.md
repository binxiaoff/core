Documentation
=======

Introduction
-------------
Do not hesitate to document the code.

Format
-------
The documentation should be in markdown. Strive to use the most basic markdown and avoid to rely on GFM (Gitlab Flavored Makdown).

Organization
------------
It should be placed based on its target audience.

The dev folder for technical documentation. The functionnal folder for external users.

In both of these folder, if a documentation is specific for a product, put it in a folder named by the concerned product.

Diagrams
--------
We recommand but do not enforce the usage of [draw.io](https://draw.io) to generate the diagrams. We only require you to externalize any schema, diagrams or any kind of assets and import them in the file. Whatever the solution you choose, it must allow others to edit the diagram easely.
